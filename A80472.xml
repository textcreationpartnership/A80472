            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Received yours of the 15<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne you all thankes for your Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, which imports the <hi>haſtning,</hi> if not the <hi>precipitation</hi> of a <hi>Treaty,</hi> to which I <hi>wiſh</hi>es good an end as is <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected</hi> from it by the common voyce of the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> who being not the beſt Judges of things, haſtily embrace and <hi>declare,</hi> and <hi>countenance</hi> that which firſt makes it ſelfe obvious and pleaſing to the <hi>fancy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But indeed Sir, (for you are one with whom I dare bee free) Men of the moſt <hi>honeſty</hi> and <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> can by no meanes give way to any ſuch <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,</hi> but rather conceive, nay feare that the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:116754:3"/>
               <hi>drift</hi> of a <hi>Perſonall Treaty,</hi> is one of the deſignes of the <hi>olde Serpent</hi> among us, and that which if obtained, is meerely to put the <hi>KING</hi> in a capacity to <hi>Ast</hi> for <hi>Himſelfe;</hi> or in caſe that faile, to make way for His <hi>eſcape.</hi> And verily Sir, if you thoroughly conſider it, the former is not wholly free from <hi>Iealouſie.</hi> Eor if you pleaſe to remember a part of one of the <hi>KINGS Letters</hi> which Hee intended to have ſent into <hi>Scotland</hi> by <hi>Haliburton:</hi> Hee there deſires Duke <hi>Hamilton to PROMOTE the buſineſſe for a PERSO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NALL TREATY as faſt as Hee can, and when that is done Hee will play His part Himſelfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I beſeech you Sir, if the KING really intended a <hi>Treaty,</hi> and a faire <hi>correſpondency</hi> with His People, what needed all theſe <hi>packings</hi> and <hi>ſhufflings,</hi> and why may Hee not <hi>Fairely</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably comply</hi> with His <hi>PARLIAMENT</hi> without any further <hi>Deluſions.</hi> Not to ſay any thing of the <hi>Bragges</hi> of many of His <hi>owne Party</hi> (who pretend to be deepely acquainted with His Intereſt) that that is the beſt and hopefulleſt <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> that ever they had, and that which hath alſo <hi>thriven</hi> the beſt.

               <hi>Buſineſſe,</hi> and that <hi>They</hi> will never bee able to looke him in the face, as who ſhould ſay, ſtanding for our <hi>Lawes</hi> and <hi>Liberties,</hi> was ſo great and unpardonable an <hi>errour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But indeed we have juſtly cauſe to feare an <hi>Eſcape;</hi> For not to mention the <hi>olde At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,</hi> the Engines whereof ſhould have beene thoſe baſe and unworthy fellowes, <hi>Osborn</hi> and <hi>Dowcet,</hi> who thought by the falſe <hi>tranſlation</hi> of the <hi>guilt</hi> to another, to have becom'd <hi>innocent.</hi> It is alſo knowne how <hi>Aſhburnham</hi> and <hi>Legge</hi> lurked in ſecret pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces near the <hi>Iſle,</hi> &amp; were once taken, which doubtleſſe was not without ſome expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>Deſigne,</hi> which now ſeemes to bee more fairely carried on; For theſe very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Hee demands for Attendants, as alſo <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Firebrace,</hi> men as <hi>experimented</hi> in theſe occaſions, and ſuch as hee was, by no meanes <hi>forced</hi> to <hi>nominate,</hi> ſince he might have had the choyſe of many other more <hi>unblemiſh'd</hi> and unſpotted <hi>reputations.</hi> Nay among theſe there may be <hi>Dowcet</hi> too, an <hi>Alien</hi> noted with breach of Truſt, and one
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:116754:4"/>that was ſo neerely concern'd in his former intended <hi>Eſcape.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And truly 'tis a wonder that <hi>Dowcet</hi> (one whom hee had formerly ſo much truſted) was not <hi>ſummon'd</hi> to this <hi>employment:</hi> But I wonder what the King meanes by ſending for ſo many <hi>riding ſuits,</hi> and ſo many <hi>horſes</hi> ſent to him, unleſſe thete were <hi>ſtrong hints</hi> of ſuch a <hi>Deſigne.</hi> But they will object that He hath paſs'd.
